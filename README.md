## Introduction

Museums and galleries are seeking an online approach to managing their exhibitions and exhibits. They also want to find an effective and efficient way to show their content to more visitors and increase their popularity. Especially in the current pandemic situation where social distancing is essential, an online platform is needed. The museums and galleries that have existing website usually spend plenty of time communicating with the website manager about how to display their content. 

“GuideXP” is a web-based platform that helps museums and galleries create and manage their digital content. It aims to build a clean and user-friendly content management system for users to upload and manage exhibition-related content. “Flexibility” is one of the critical values we are offering. Users are able to arrange and design their content such as texts, images, audios, and videos in a rich text editor and see how it is is shown to the visitors. Visitors can use "GuideXP" as a companion when they are visiting museums and galleries or explore them online in the comfort of their home.

This semester, we are focusing on gathering and analysing visitors' activities in the website to create meaningful analytics page for museums and galleries.
